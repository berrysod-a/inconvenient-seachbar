🔍 Inconvenient Search Engine

A playful and frustrating search engine that makes finding what you're looking for intentionally difficult!

## How it works

1. **Search for anything** - Type in your search term and click "Search"
2. **Find the correct result** - Your search term will appear as a green box among 10 random wrong answers
3. **Deal with the chaos** - Some wrong results will "run away" when you hover over them, making them even harder to click
4. **Eliminate wrong answers** - Click on wrong results to remove them
5. **Claim your victory** - Once only the correct result remains, click it to celebrate!

## Features

- 🎯 One correct result (your search term) in green
- 🎲 10 random wrong results from a curated list of absurd items
- 🏃‍♂️ Some results "run away" when you hover over them (30% chance)
- 🎮 Interactive click-to-eliminate gameplay
- 🎉 Victory celebration when you find the correct result

## Try it out

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser to start playing!

## 🎵 Music Feature

The search engine includes the **Gravity Suit theme from Jetpack Joyride** that plays when transitioning to pixel mode!

### Adding the Music File:

1. **Download the Gravity Suit theme** from Jetpack Joyride (or use your own 8-bit music)
2. **Save it as** `gravity-suit-theme.mp3` in the project root directory
3. **Alternative format** - also supports `gravity-suit-theme.ogg`

### Music Controls:

- **Automatic playback** when entering pixel mode
- **Music toggle button** (🔊/🔇) in the top-left corner
- **Automatic stop** when returning to normal mode
- **Volume set to 30%** for comfortable listening

## The Challenge

This search engine is designed to be inconvenient on purpose. The correct result is always there, but finding it requires patience, precision, and a sense of humor. Can you find what you're searching for?
