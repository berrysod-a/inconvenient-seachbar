# 🔍 Inconvenient Search Engine

A playful and frustrating search engine that makes finding what you're looking for intentionally difficult!

## How it works

1. **Search for anything** - Type in your search term and click "Search"
2. **Find the correct result** - Your search term will appear as a green box among 10 random wrong answers
3. **Deal with the chaos** - Some wrong results will "run away" when you hover over them, making them even harder to click
4. **Eliminate wrong answers** - Click on wrong results to remove them
5. **Claim your victory** - Once only the correct result remains, click it to celebrate!

## Features

- 🎯 One correct result (your search term) in green
- 🎲 10 random wrong results from a curated list of absurd items
- 🏃‍♂️ Some results "run away" when you hover over them (30% chance)
- 🎮 Interactive click-to-eliminate gameplay
- 🎉 Victory celebration when you find the correct result

## The Challenge
