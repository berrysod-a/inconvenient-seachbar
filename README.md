# 🔍 Search Engine

A playful and frustrating search engine that makes finding what you're looking for intentionally difficult!

## Team Members:
- **Nicole Mercy Daison** - Christ College of Engineering
- **Theresa Antony** - Christ College of Engineering

## Project Description
This is a search engine that delivers results no-one asked for. What looks like a normal search engine at first glance, turns into a pixelated inconvenient game experience.

## How it works

1. **Search for anything** - Type in your search term and click "Search"
2. **Enter pixel mode** - The interface transforms into a retro gaming experience
3. **Play mini-games** - Complete one of three random mini-games:
   - **🎯 Elimination Challenge** - Click wrong results to eliminate them
   - **📚 Stack Puzzle** - Drag items out of stack (LIFO)
   - **🔒 Cage Puzzle** - Find key to unlock cage
4. **Claim your victory** - Complete the game to see your search results

## Features

- **Three mini-games** with different mechanics
- **Pixel art aesthetic** with retro gaming vibes
- **Smooth transitions** between normal and pixel modes
- **Interactive gameplay** with drag-and-drop mechanics
- **🎵 Music integration** with Gravity Suit theme from Jetpack Joyride

## 🎵 Music Feature

The search engine includes the **Gravity Suit theme from Jetpack Joyride** that plays when transitioning to pixel mode!

### Adding the Music File:

1. **Download the Gravity Suit theme** from Jetpack Joyride (or use your own 8-bit music)
2. **Save it as** `gravity-suit-theme.mp3` in the project root directory
3. **Alternative format** - also supports `gravity-suit-theme.ogg`

### Music Controls:

- **Automatic playback** when entering pixel mode
- **Music toggle button** (🔊/🔇) in the top-left corner
- **Automatic stop** when returning to normal mode
- **Volume set to 30%** for comfortable listening
- **Smooth fade-in/fade-out** effects

## Try it out

Simply open `index.html` in your web browser to start playing!

## The Challenge

This search engine is designed to be inconvenient on purpose. The correct result is always there, but finding it requires patience, precision, and a sense of humor. Can you find what you're searching for?
